# Difficulty_Level_Estimation-of-Math-Problems

<B>Project Description:</B>

This project focuses on estimating the difficulty levels of math problems within a dataset. The difficulty level of math problems can play a crucial role in educational settings, helping to provide appropriate challenges to students. By utilizing machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we aim to automatically assess the difficulty of math problems based on their content.

<B>DATASET:</B>
The MATH dataset consists of problems from mathematics competitions including the AMC 10, AMC 12, AIME, and more. Many of these problems can be collected from aops.com/community/c3158_usa_contests. 
The Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics dataset, abbreviated MATH, has 12,500 problems (7,500 training and 5,000 test). With this many training problems, models can learn many useful heuristics for problem solving. Each problem has a step-by-step solution and a final boxed answer.
The folder contains the train and test examples for the MATH dataset. The train set has 7,500 examples and the test set has 5,000 examples. All the problems are LATEX Encoded.
